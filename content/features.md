## Replying

You can also post a reply to anything on the web. Right-click and select “Reply to entry” to write a reply. This will reply to the current URL.

If the current page is published with valid [microformats](http://indieweb.org/microformats), you can reply to any “h-entry” on the page. When you right-click an h-entry, it will be highlighted in yellow. Your reply will be posted against the highlighted entry.
