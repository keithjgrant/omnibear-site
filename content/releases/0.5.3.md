With this release, Omnibear works in Firefox. Unfortunately, there is still a little bit of cleanup to do in order to get it accepted into the Firefox Add-on store, but if you are comfortable doing a dev install on your own, you can give it a test run.

Other changes:

* Fixes issues finding and highlighting the `h-entry` when right-clicked.
* Includes some permissions fixes to try to get Omnibear working in other browsers besides Chrome
